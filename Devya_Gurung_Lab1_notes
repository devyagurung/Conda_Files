## LAB 5 3_4_22
# Review for practical ~ 
# Reads length, grep line ~  

# commands to review 
ls - output contents of folder
cd - change dir 
pwd - print working dir
mv - move file to relative 
cp - copy 
cat - concatonate, make one come after other, print all to screen or command lines 
grep - string, searches through a file for string match 
wc - word count # of chr, words, # line 
mkdir - make directory
rm - remove 

echo - 

## how to set diff option for command with '-'
- ex: 'ls -ltrh' # changes how much info is provided 

## absolute path:
- very useful for getting to your folder no matter where you are. 
- star with '/' ex: /Users/ 
go to Gen file ~


# Relative path 
- get you where you want to go from directory (folder that you are currently in )

## Special Character 
~ glob '*' (wildcard) is use to match 
- pipe '|' (bar) send the output of the commamd to another command

# Ex
command 1 | command 2
ls | wc 

### Programs 
- nano 
- less 

# ls -ltrh gives you the time as well, the most recent ones

# Practice Practical

## change working directory 

### Use grep to search for a bad read ( any read with 7 uncalled bases in a row )
grep 'NNNNNNN' SRR097977.fastq

# can do -S only for less command, not for head 
less -S SRR097977.fastq

# output 
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## head 

@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN


### Use the 'B' option to get line above each match 

grep -B1 'NNNNNNNN' SRR098026.fastq

#output
@SRR098026.221 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:1:844 length=35
ANNNNNNCCAGTTGTGCTTTTNNNNNNNNCGTTAA


### How many lines below each grep line belong to a read?
2 

### Use the 'A' and 'B' options with grep to return the read and info lines for each match
grep -A2 -B1 'NNNNNNN' SRR098026.fastq

# A is for after and B is for before. 
## C and D? 


### Redirect the bad reads in SRR098026.fastq to a file called bad_reads.fastq 

grep -A2 -B1 'NNNNNNN' SRR098026.fastq > bad_reads.fastq


### Determine how many lines are in this file

wc - l bad_reads.fastq 

### Redirect the bad reads for both fastqs into bad_reads.txt at the same time
grep -A2 -B1 'NNNNNNN' *fastq > bad_reads.txt
# selecting fastq together  * 
# if you put in the same file, you get error or freeze because the file is reading itself. 
grep -A2 -B1 'NNNNNNN' *fastq > bad_reads.fastq

### Determine how many bad read lines are in each of the fastq lines, and compare that with the number of lines in bad_reads.fastq


### Have a look in the file to find out what is wrong

### Use a reverse grep to remove the lines that

grep -v thisstring file 
grep NNNNNN fastq | grep -v thisstring

### Add your name to the bottom of the bad_reads.fastq 
# append 
ls > list.txt 

pwd >> list.txt 

# how to do it ? adding your name to lis 

echo  'Devya G' >> list.txt

# most of the stuff goes to list file

### Add your name to the top of the bad_reads.fastq 
# adding on top of the list 

nano 
# you can do nano and add your name to the file list

### Make a script that makes a file of bad reads 

### change the permissions of the file and run the script
# chmod 755 

### add your name to the end of new bad reads file 
#! /bin/bash 
nano

### Run md5sum on scripted_bad_reads.txt and write the output to my_md5sum.txt


## bwa aligns the reads 
# Formality of your script , bin: binary, bash: command line 
bwa sample.fastq reference.fasta > sample.alignemnt.sam 

# this will take alignments, gatk look at variants caller. 
gatk sample.alignemnt.sam reference.fasta > sample_genotypes.vcf

QIIME 2â„¢ is a next-generation microbiome bioinformatics platform that is extensible, 
free, open source, and community developed.

# Quality filtering 
# DADA2 : corrects erroneous sequences using an error model. 


# OTU clustering : might indicate the samples in read to be the same. 
OTU = operational taxonomic unit, 97% similarity 
ASV = amplicon sequence variant, 99% similarity  
# decision of whether to continue 

# Taxonomy - uses a reference databases 
# ITS is usefule for species and phylogenies. 

# Alpha Rarefaction plotting 
# different scores will skew your results, along with different starting materials. 

# so, the # Alpha Rarefaction plotting comes in 
# Tradeoff between a high sampling depth and losing samples from the dataset. 


# Normalization 
# Good if you have uniform, same # of reads. 
# Library sizes can be different and you can do statistics on them. 
## you can do proportion % abundance, log transform, DESeq.
