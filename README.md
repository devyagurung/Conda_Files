1. Background: 

Cancer is a byproduct of many dysregulations, both within the cell and in the tumor microenvironment. It can occur due to mutations, or environmental factors. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers found in women. In the United States alone, 255,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women and 2300 in men (CDC). Breast cancer is caused when cells in breast grow uncontrollably. In the study where I gathered raw fastq data from studied the breast cancer in genetically engineered mouse models. The mouse models carried Trp53-mutated breast cancer, along with Brca1 and Brca2 associated breast cancer and E-cadherin (Cdh1) mutated lobular breast cancer. 

This study was done in mice model to further understand the mechanism in human breast cancer. Cancer compromises the functions of the immune system, therefore understanding how it regulates cells and the microenvironment is vital in developing cancer immunotherapy.
